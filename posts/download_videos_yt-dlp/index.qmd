## The problem

This past week one of my colleagues on the NPR investigations team needed to download a subcommittee hearing from the [U.S Senate Committee on the Judiciary](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov). 

When downloading videos from youtube I always use the command line tool [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). Normally it is as simple typing the program's name and the url of the video you are trying to download:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
yt-dlp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfe5kMbFGuE
```

However the U.S Senate Committee on the Judiciary website makes things a bit more difficult. If we put in the [url](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/pregnancy-in-georgias-prisons) of the webpage that the video is located on we get the following error:

!["ERROR: Unable to extract url"](photos/yt-dlp_error.png)

Let's see how to grab the video off their website!

## Download yt-dlp

First make sure you download yt-dlp. Their [github](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) has instructions for any computer that you are, whether thats windows, mac, or linux.

Since I am on a mac I will use the [homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh):

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
brew install yt-dlp
```


## Finding the correct url

When websites play videos that they host on their own website, there will usually be a `.m3u8` file. A M3U8 file is simply a text file that contains the location of files that your browser will stream^[https://www.thetechedvocate.org/what-is-an-m3u8-file/]

To find the text file follow these steps:

1. Open up your developer settings of your browser^[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools]
2. Navigate to the `Network` tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Search for and then click the .m3u8 file
5. Find the url that ends in .m3u8

In this case the url is:

> https://www-senate-gov-media-srs.akamaized.net/hls/live/2036788/judiciary/judiciary102523p/master.m3u8

Remember how I said that a .m3u8 file is just a set of instructions and locations regarding a video? If you were to put the url into your browser it would download the file which looks like this:

::: {.callout-note}

## .m3u8 file

{{< include data/master.m3u8 >}}

:::

## Download the video

If we give `yt-dlp` the .m3u8 url it will download the video!

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}

yt-dlp https://www-senate-gov-media-srs.akamaized.net/hls/live/2036788/judiciary/judiciary102523p/master.m3u8

```

Congrats the video has downloaded! If you are unsure the location the video was downloaded, just type the following into the terminal:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
open .
```

Let me know if you have any questions!
